embed or not?

embed means to combine entities, 
for example, a blog schema, the post entities will include auther, comments, tags

it is good to embed in this case becasue
- most time it is just access from post, i.e. you don't enter a blog for comments
- a problem with embed is that, say if you change a tag, from bycle to cycling, you will
  need to change multiple records. but this kind of update is rare. so you'll be fine.
 
it is impossible to embed in case a document is > 16MB, which is maximum size for mongoDB document
